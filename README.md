Introduction

This project is to assist in demonstrated how to utilize Selenium WebDriver in C# to automate a manual process that consumes time and repeatable.  I selected C# as this project's language due to my coworkers develop using C# and I feel most comfortable with it, but I could potentially see myself writing similar project in a different language in future.  

Getting Started

To get started: you will need to have Visual Studio 2015 (at least Community version), which could be downloaded here: https://www.visualstudio.com/. Then after installing Visual Studio, you can clone this project by using git:

git clone https://github.com/minoseah629/seleniumcsharp.git

Open SeleniumDemo.sln in Visual Studio

Build Solution

During this build, Visual Studio will be downloading the dependencies from nuget.org so the solution needs to build correctly. 

1. Selenium WebDriver version 2.53.1
2. xUnit and underlying xUnit dependencies latest version
3. Selenium.Support version 2.53.1
4. Selenium.WebDriver.Extensions 2.0.0

If the build succeeds, then you can start creating Selenium tests.
